% ******************************* Thesis Dedidcation ********************************

\begin{dedication}

I would like to dedicate this thesis to my loving parents, Luping and Yueli,
who have supported me at all steps of my journey through life and academia. And
to my sister, Dawn, whom I am much too sleep-deprived to write a dedication for
but you know I love you regardless.
