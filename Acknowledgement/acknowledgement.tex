 I would like to acknowledge Mark Gotham, my primary point of contact for
 anything music related. This thesis would not be possible without his
 assistance teaching me music theory, offering feedback on intermediate results,
 and providing analyses requiring expertise in music theory.

 I would also like to acknowledge my industry sponsors, Matthew Johnson
 and Jamie Shotton from Microsoft Research Cambridge, for their role
 proposing the idea of BachBat, providing computing resources, and
 and giving me regular feedback on the progress of the project.

 In addition, I would like to acknowledge Bill Byrne's support guiding me through
 the thesis writing proces.

 Finally, I would like to acknowledge my proofreaders and reviewers, which
 include all of the aforementioned as well asNiole Nelson, Kyle
 Kastner, and Tom Nicholson.
