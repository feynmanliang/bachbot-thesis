  What can we say about the perception of music by the silent majority of
  listeners, those for whom music is written but who neither create music nor
  can articulate their musical experience? How do they acquire their
  demonstrably sophisticated intuitions about music patterns
  typical of their culture? Experiments in the cognitive psychology of music
  have cast some light on the first question. Recent developments in neural net learning
  now enables us to explore the second.

Evaluation of automatic composition systems is still a difficult question with
no generally-accepted solution. While many recent models use log-likelihood on
the \textit{JCB Chorales} \citep{Allan2005} as as a benchmark for comparing
performance
\citep{Boulanger-Lewandowski2012,bayer2013fast,pascanu2013construct,goel2014polyphonic,zaremba2015empirical,Lyu2015},
this evaluation merely measures a model's ability to approximate a probability
distribution given limited data and does not correspond with success as an
automatic composition problem.

\citet{pearce2001towards,pearce2002motivations} attribute difficulty in
evaluation due to lack aim, claiming that studies in automatic music generation
do not clearly define their goals. They proceed to differentiate between three
different goals for automatic music generation research, each with different
evaluation criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Automatic composition
  \item Design of compositional tools
  \item Computational modelling of music style/cognition
\end{enumerate}

While our model design and analysis has happened to yield interesting results
relating to music cognition (\cref{ch:model-analysis}), it has not been the aim
of our work. As initially stated in \cref{ch:intro}, \emph{the aim of our work is
automatic composition}: to produce a system which automatically composes music
indistinguishable from Bach.

To directly measure our success on this task, we adapt Alan Turing's proposed
``Imitation Game'' \citep{turing1950computing} into a musical Turing test.
Although some authors \citep{ariza2009interrogator} are critical of such tests'
ability to provide meaningful data which can be utilized to improve the system,
their recommended alternative of listener studies with music experts is
cost-prohibitive and generates a small sample of free-form text responses which
must be manually analyzed.

\section{Evaluation framework design}

In this section, we describe the design of a software framework for conducting
large-scale a musical Turing test which was deployed to \url{http://bachbot.com/}
and used to evaluate our model on human evaluators.

\subsection{Software architecture}

We architected the evaluation framework with two requirements in mind:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It must scale in a cost-efficient manner to meet rapid growth
  \item It must be easily adaptable for usage by others
\end{enumerate}

Our scalability requirement motivated our choice for using a cloud service
provider to manage infrastructure. While multiple options for providers, we
chose to use Microsoft Azure. Our application is built using
Node.js\footnote{\url{https://nodejs.org/en/}} and is hosted by Azure App
Services. We host static content (\eg audio samples) using Azure CDN to offload
bandwidth. Responses collected from the survey are stored in Azure BlobStore, a
distributed object store supporting batch MapReduce processing using Hadoop on
HDInsight.

The frontend is built using
React\footnote{\url{https://facebook.github.io/react/}} and
Redux\footnote{\url{http://redux.js.org/}}. We chose these frameworks because
their current popularity in front-end web development implies familiarity by a
large number of users, achieving our second software requirement. Additionally,
Redux enables fine-grained instrumentation of user actions and allows us to
collect detailed data such as when users play/pause the sample.

\subsection{User interface}

The landing page for \url{http://bachbot.com/} is shown in \cref{fig:bachbot-front-page}.

  \caption{The first page seen by a visitor of \url{http://bachbot.com}}
  \label{fig:bachbot-front-page}
\end{figure}

Clicking ``Test Yourself'' redirects the participant to a user information form
(\cref{fig:user-info-form}) where users self-report their age
group prior music experience into the categories shown.

  \caption{User information form presented after clicking ``Test Yourself''}
  \label{fig:user-info-form}
\end{figure}

After submitting the background form, users were redirected to the question
response page shown in \cref{fig:question-screen}. This page contains two
audio samples, one extracted from Bach and one generated by BachBot, and users
were asked to select the sample which sounds most similar to Bach. Users were
asked to provide five consecutive answers and then the overall percentage
correct was reported.

  \caption{Question response interface used for all questions}
  \label{fig:question-screen}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Question generation}

Questions were generated for both harmonizations produced using the method
proposed in \cref{ch:harmonization} as well as automatic compositions generated
by sequentially sampling the model from \cref{ch:automatic-composition}. We
re-use notation from \cref{sec:harm-dataset} and use ``SATB'' to denote
unconstrained automatic composition.

For each question, a random chorale was selected without replacement from the
corpus and paired with a corresponding harmonization. SATB samples were paired
with chorales randomly sampled from the corpus. The five question answered by
any given participant were comprised of one S/A/T/B question chosen at random,
one AT question, one ATB question, and two original compositions. See
\cref{tab:bachbot-com-question-distribtion} for details.

\begin{table}[tb]

  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
    \toprule
    Question type & \# questions available & Expected \# responses per participant \\
    \midrule
    S        & 2  & 0.25 \\
    A        & 2  & 0.25 \\
    T        & 2  & 0.25 \\
    B        & 2  & 0.25 \\
    AT       & 8  & 1 \\
    ATB      & 8  & 1 \\
    SATB     & 12 & 2 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Promoting the study}

Unlike prior studies which leverage paid services like Amazon MTurk for human
feedback \cite{quick2014kulitta}, we do not not compensate participants and
promote our study only through social media and personal contacts.
Participation was voluntary and growth was organic; we did not solicit any paid
responses or advertising.

We found that $50\%$ of participants were referred from social media, $4.8\%$
through other websites and blogs, $2.6\%$ through search engine results, and
the remaining $42.6\%$ had directly accessed \url{bachbot.com},

\section{Results}\label{sec:eval-results}

\subsection{Participant backgrounds and demographics}

At the time of writing, we received a total of $759$ participants from $54$
different countries. After selecting only the first response per IP address and
filtering down to participants whom had played both choices in every question
at least once, we are left with $721$ participants answering $5$ questions each
to yield a total of $3605$ responses.

As evidenced by \vref{fig:user-geographics}, our participant is diverse and
includes participants from six different continents.
\vref{fig:user-demographics} shows that the majority of our participants are
between $18-45$ and have played an instrument. The large number of participants
with significant music experience is larger than our expectations: more than
$24.13\%$ of participants have either formally studied or taught music theory.
This large proportion of advanced participants shows that voluntary studies
promoted through social media can generate significant participation by expert
users interested in the problem domain.

\subsection{BachBot's performance results}

\begin{figure}[tb]

  \caption{Proportion of participants correctly discriminating Bach from BachBot for each question type.}
  \label{fig:responses-mask}
\end{figure}

  \centering
  \input{Chapter7/Figs/responses-mask-musicExperience.pgf}
  \caption{Proportion of correct responses for each question type and music experience level.}
  \label{fig:responses-mask-musicExperience}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:responses-mask} shows the performance of BachBot on various question
types. The SATB column shows that participants on average successfully
discriminated Bach from BachBot only $59\%$ of the time. As the baseline method
of randomly guessing between the two choices in \cref{fig:question-screen}
achieves $50\%$, our findings suggest that \emph{the pool of participants on
average could only perform $9\%$ better than random guessing}. This is a much
lower number than we anticipated and provides strong evidence affirming successful
accomplishment of our research goals.

In \cref{fig:responses-mask-musicExperience}, responses are further segmented
by music experience. Unsurprisingly, we find that the proportion of correct responses
correlates positively with experience.

The weaker performance of BachBot's outputs on harmonization questions
(\cref{fig:responses-mask}, AT, ATB) compared to automatic composition
questions (\cref{fig:responses-mask}, SATB) is counterintuitive as one might
expect the provided parts to better aid the model to create more Bach-like
music. However, this result is expected and can be explained by the
shortcomings of our greedy $1$-best harmonization method noted in
\vref{sec:shortcomings-harm}.

BachBot's results compare favourably against a recently published comparable
automatic stylistic composition system \citep{collins2016developing}, which
found that $5$ out of $25$ participants were able to significantly
differentiate their generated compositions from Bach. However, the comparison
must be interpreted with case as \citet{collins2016developing} evaluate on a
highly experienced participant pool averaging $8.56$.

When only a single part is composed by BachBot, we find the results vary
significantly across different parts. Composing only the Soprano part proved to be
the easiest to discriminate, an unsurprising result given that in chorale style
music soprano parts are responsible for the melody \citep{denny1960oxford}.
Composing only the Alto or Tenor parts achieved similar performance as composing
all four parts.

However, using BachBot to compose new bass parts for Bach chorales yielded
surprisingly successful results. \Cref{fig:responses-mask} shows that
participants could not correctly discriminate Bach from BachBot any better than
random guessing, and \cref{fig:responses-mask-musicExperience} showed that even
advanced and expert participants could not distinguish the two. This may be due
to BachBot's lower error rates harmonizing Bass parts compared to any other
part (\vref{fig:harmonization-results}), or it could also suggest that Bass
parts are least significant in defining Bach's compositional style.

\subsubsection{Certain compositions by BachBot cannot be significantly discriminated Bach}

\cref{fig:responses-name} shows the proportion correct of correct responses
received for each question. Encouragingly, it shows that more than a quarter of
the SATB pairs were not insignificantly different from baseline, suggesting
that \textbf{while not always consistent BachBot is capable of composing music
which the average participant cannot discern from actual Bach}. While we lack the
expertise, one valuable extension would be to review the samples which performed
abnormally well and poor and attempt to identify some regularities among them.

% \section{User feedback}

% We showcase some of the particularly helpful feedback we received from our
% users and observe that some common themes are present among the features
% participants used to discriminate synthetic from original Bach.

% Most critically, we found that lack of convincing phrasing to be one of the most
% cited difference between BachBot and real Bach:
% \begin{quote}
%   The modulations and part writing were the giveaway for me (and once or twice the phrasing)
% \end{quote}

% \begin{quote}
%   Got 5/5. The trick is to listen for the unnatural pauses at regular intervals.
% \end{quote}

% \begin{quote}
%   Cool project, I scored 100\% so I'm quite pleased with myself ;o) I do
%   play an instrument although I'm not classical trained. If I had an
%   inkling to why I could choose the background phrasing of the Bach
%   pieces is far more elegant than the computer generated pieces.
% \end{quote}


% \begin{quote}
%   really impressive! If I didn't know about counterpoint that quiz would've stumped me
% \end{quote}

% We also found that certain participants who have studied Bach chorales could recognize
% certain scores despite normalizing key and tempo:
% \begin{quote}
%   [BWV-248.5 ATB]
%   \#2: there was a first inversion at a strong cadence point that just wasn't
%   credible in the non-Bach clip (of course I am sure you can point to a piece
%   of Bach that does end on a first inversion!)

%   [BWV-248.5 ATB]
%   \#3: this was the hardest one to judge in my opinion. I went on gut feeling
%   of the first section, before the very slow part that I suspect may be an
%   artefact of the tempo normalisation that you have done. Were there perhaps
%   fewer open chords in the genuine Bach?

%   [BWV-11.6 B]
%   \#4: the harmony felt quit wrong in this one - too many weird chromatic
%   harmonies and semitone clashes even for JSB and it ended in the wrong key.

%   [BWV-436 SATB]
%   \#5: this one I found quite easy, partly because I recognised it, but also
%   because the algorithm was perhaps trying to be too clever and turn too many
%   harmonic corners in too quick a succession

%   Further, although I couldn't quote BWV numbers to you, I recognised samples 2
%   and 5, though the performance of \#2 in particular seemed highly ornamented
%   and embellished.

%   The whole thing is really quite impressive overall though\ldots

% \section{Competitive analysis of large-scale evaluation methodologies}

% In cont


% \mynote{Breakdown costs of Azure CDN, App Service, BlobStore. Most expensive was domain registration}

% \mynote{Compare costs and quality with MTurk}

% Higher quality. Music experts are not usually doing tasks on MTurk, but would
% be very interested in an open-source research project. In contrast, $20\%$
% \mynote{UPDATE THIS NUMBER} of our participants have either formally studied
% or taught music theory.

% \begin{quote}
% Payments on MTurk are suggested to follow a reasonable hourly rate, with an
% example of \$8 per hour or about 13c per minute. In practice, many mTurk
% tasks pay much less overall, with the median study paying just 5-10c for a task
% taking ``a few minutes,'' like watching and providing feedback on 3 short
% (15-second) videos, summarizing a website, and evaluating hypothetical and real
% market products. Indeed, ``wages'' this low have been shown to result in lower
% quality output than could be had for no payment at all, by pure volunteers.
% \end{quote}
% \citep{downs2010your}

% MTurk is also crestricted to US participants only\cite{quick2014kulitta}.

% Paid service providers cost anywhere from \$20 to \$55 per month
% just for authoring tools and server space\citep{JCC4:JCC411} At the time of writing,
% paid responses cost \$1.50--\$3.00 on SurveyMonkey \citep{uksurveymonkey}.
